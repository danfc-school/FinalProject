# Final Project README
## Author: Daniel Carosello 2579083
This Java project that simulates the coding behind a Cegep students career by going over their address,department, enrollement, assignments,  and course. This project also tests all of that using a unit testing class.  
***
### Class1 Address
This class stores the students:
Street Number
Street Name
City
Province
Postal Code

This class also ensures that the postal code is valid (CDCDCD format) and puts all this info into a valid format.
***
### Class2 Department
This class is like an academic department, it:
Stores department names
Auto Generated department Id's
Validates Department names (Letters and spaces)
***
### Class3 Student
This class manages a students:
Course registration
Academic info
Registered courses

This class also auto generates student id's
***
### Class4 Assignment
This class stores an assignments:
Name
Weight
Score

This class generates random test scores and calculates averages.
This class also auto generates assignment Ids
***
### Class5 Course
This class manages:
Assignments
Stugrents (registered)

This class Calculates weighted scores and displays grades in a table
Finally, this class auto generates course Id's and makes sure that the assignments weights equals up to 100%.
***
### Class6 Util
As the conclusion to the whole system, This class tests every method that could be tested and also converts strings to title case.
***
## Result
As a result of completing this project, I have shown my ability to write a multitude of code used for a fictional school system, this included writting fields, methods, loops, using lombok for getters, setters, to strings and equal methods and using all this across mutiple java classes to complete it.
