# Final Project README
## Author: Daniel Carosello 2579083
This Java project that simulates the coding behind a Cegep students career by going over their address,department, enrollement, assignments,  and course. This project also tests all of that using a unit testing class.  
***
### Class1 Address
This class stores the students:
<br>Street Number
<br>Street Name
<br>City
<br>Province
<br>Postal Code

<br>This class also ensures that the postal code is valid (CDCDCD format) and puts all this info into a valid format.
***
### Class2 Department
This class is like an academic department, it:
<br>Stores department names
<br>Auto Generated department Id's
<br>Validates Department names (Letters and spaces)
***
### Class3 Student
This class manages a students:
<br>Course registration
<br>Academic info
<br>Registered courses

<br>This class also auto generates student id's
***
### Class4 Assignment
This class stores an assignments:
<br>Name
<br>Weight
<br>Score

<br>This class generates random test scores and calculates averages.
<br>This class also auto generates assignment Ids
***
### Class5 Course
This class manages:
<br>Assignments
<br>Stugrents (registered)

<br>This class Calculates weighted scores and displays grades in a table
<br>Finally, this class auto generates course Id's and makes sure that the assignments weights equals up to 100%.
***
### Class6 Util
<br>As the conclusion to the whole system, This class tests every method that could be tested and also converts strings to title case.
***
## Result
<br>As a result of completing this project, I have shown my ability to write a multitude of code used for a fictional school system, this included writting fields, methods, loops, using lombok for getters, setters, to strings and equal methods and using all this across mutiple java classes to complete it.
